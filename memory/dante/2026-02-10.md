## Agent Configuration
- Set Kimi K2.5 as primary model with Claude Sonnet 4.5 as fallback #1, Gemini 3 Flash Preview as fallback #2
- Web search (Brave API) and Moonshot AI fully configured
- Dante v2 fully operational on Hostinger VPS

## Competitive Intelligence: BJJLINK
- Founded 2018 in San Diego by 3 lifelong grapplers
- Pricing: Black ($49/mo + 1% fee) / Coral ($149/mo, no fee) - unlimited students
- Only 9 Trustpilot reviews in 7 years = small user base, weak distribution
- Core features: student management, scheduling, billing, rank tracking, curriculum builder, marketing tools
- **Missing:** Photo feed/social component (RollCall opportunity)
- **Strengths:** BJJ-specific, staff trains BJJ, Clark Gracie testimonial
- Reddit sentiment positive but low volume

## RollCall Strategy Discussion
- **Pricing strategy:** $39/mo unlimited members (undercuts BJJLINK, skull-fuck the market)
- **Target:** 1,000 gyms in 2 years = $468K/year revenue
- **Base44 scaling:**
  - Phase 1 (0-50 gyms): Base44 Elite ($160/mo)
  - Phase 2 (50-200 gyms): Evaluate Base44 Enterprise
  - Phase 3 (200+ gyms): Rebuild on Next.js + Supabase multi-tenant
  - Estimated costs at 1,000 gyms: $2,500-4,500/mo (88-93% margins)
- **Key question:** Can Base44 do multi-tenancy (1 app, 1,000 gyms) or is it 1,000 separate apps?

## Competitive Landscape
- BJJLINK: Weak distribution, no photo feed
- Gymdesk: Probable leader for martial arts
- Zen Planner: Big, bloated, expensive
- MindBody: Overpriced, gyms leaving

## Key Differentiators for RollCall
1. Photo feed (gym Instagram) - NOBODY has this
2. UFC fighter partnership - instant credibility, viral distribution
3. $39/mo unlimited pricing - most aggressive in market
4. PIN check-in kiosk
5. Promotion queue system for instructors

## Next Steps
- Determine Base44 multi-tenancy capabilities
- Build photo feed feature (key differentiator)
- Pre-sell 5-10 gyms to validate demand

## Evening: Agent Classifier MVP + Anniversary Dinner

### Agent Classifier Built (MVP)
- Built core classifier that routes tasks to appropriate AI model tier
- **Kimi K2.5**: Fast/cheap tasks (classification, simple analysis)
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Complex reasoning, coding, creative work
- **Gemini 3 Flash**: Quick summaries, translations, basic extraction
- MVP completed in ~15 minutes with 100% accuracy on test cases
- Remaining: Heuristic filter, logging, fallback escalation (the "30 minute" part)

### Agent Teams Research
- Watched YouTube video: Alex Finn (OpenClaw/Clawdbot creator) + Matt Van Horn on TWiST
- **The "Henry" Agent Model**:
  - Sends daily morning briefs
  - Proactive research while user is busy
  - Has own phone number (Twilio + ChatGPT voice)
  - Acts like a teammate, not just a tool
- **Concepts to steal for our setup**:
  - Daily morning brief across all projects (Ratio, RollCall, inbox, calendar)
  - Proactive monitoring agents
  - Voice/phone alerts for urgent items

### Personal Context
- Kevin celebrating anniversary at Tentaciones restaurant
- Wife has similar sense of humor (roasting dynamic) - explains the personality fit
- Currently on vacation, returns home in ~2 weeks

## Quotes

- "BJJLINK is legit but missing the social/engagement layer"
- "UFC fighter = unfair advantage"
- "I said 30 minutes to build the full system - what we built was the MVP classifier"
