## NAD+ Supplements Discussion
- **Topic:** Asked about NAD+ IV therapy offered by his doctor for recovery/energy
- **WADA Status:** ✅ Not prohibited - legal for all sports including UFC
- **Effectiveness:** Hyped more than proven, especially for athletes
- **Research:**
  - Very few studies on healthy young athletes
  - One 2021 study showed modest endurance improvement in middle-aged cyclists
  - No strong data for power, strength, or fight performance
- **Issues:**
  - IV NAD+ gets destroyed in bloodstream quickly
  - Oral supplements (NMN/NR) have poor bioavailability
  - Expensive ($500-1000+ per session)
- **Verdict:** Skip it for now - revisit when research is stronger. Basics (sleep, creatine, training) give 10x return per dollar.

## Session Notes
- Multiple heartbeat checks throughout the day (no tasks in HEARTBEAT.md)
- Currently on vacation, ~1.5 weeks until return
- System stable on VPS
