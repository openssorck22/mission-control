## Ratio App Review
- Reviewed Ratio daycare management app with Kevin
- **Login:** kevin+dante@thelearningtreend.com / Opendante
- **Lesson Plans module is DONE:**
  - Two templates (older/younger kids)
  - AI expands activity descriptions into parent-ready curriculum
  - Weekly submission tracking (Submitted/Processing/Awaiting)
  - Aggregated supplies list across all classrooms
  - Export for Brightwheel integration
  - 10 classrooms tracked by color/age group
- Next: Need to check Messages, Classrooms, Regulations, Training sections

## Business Strategy Confirmed
- **Goal:** $1M ARR lifestyle business (NOT VC-backed unicorn)
- **Target:** 2,128 customers at $39/mo = $1M ARR
- **RollCall (gym):** Launch Q2 2025, use Joe (UFC fighter partner) for distribution
- **Ratio (daycare):** Launch after RollCall proves model, harder migration but bigger market
- **AI Agent Squad:** Marketing agent for both LS Concrete and MMA gym, then offer as service to customers

## Pricing Discussion
- **RollCall:** $39/mo (gyms on thin budgets)
- **Ratio:** $59-100/mo (daycares have more cash flow, still under Brightwheel)
- Both unlimited per location (not per-child/per-member)

## Agent Squad Priorities
1. Marketing Agent (ongoing campaigns for LS Concrete, MMA gym)
2. Research Agent (competitor analysis, market intel)
3. Creative Agent (images/copy)
4. Finance Agent (reporting, tracking)

## Next Steps
- Create Notion workspaces for Ratio and RollCall with timelines
- Finish Ratio internal version (current priority)
- Wait for Mission Control HQ access for agent coordination patterns
