## Key Decisions
- **Agent Roster Finalized:**
  1. Dante (Strategic Coordinator)
  2. Gym Agent (RollCall ops)
  3. Daycare Agent (Ratio ops)
  4. Construction Agent (LS Concrete acquisition)
  5. LS Marketing Agent
  6. Social Media Agent
- **Infrastructure Plan:**
  - **Slack:** Primary communication hub. Channels mapped to agents (`#00-mission-control`, `#01-rollcall-gym`, etc.).
  - **Notion:** Knowledge base.
  - **Email:** Resend for agent send/receive (later).
- **Model Strategy:** Switched primary to `Gemini 3 Pro Preview` due to "message ordering conflicts" with Kimi. Suspect context length/corruption after 3 days of uptime.
- **Tech Stack Pivot:** Investigating **Google Antigravity** (agent-first dev platform).
  - *Strategy:* Export frontend from Base44 (React), use AI agents (Antigravity/Cursor) to rebuild backend (Python/Node + Supabase).
  - *Goal:* Break vendor lock-in, enable unlimited customization.

## Active Projects
### RollCall (Gym SaaS)
- **Status:** Considering migration from Base44 to AI-built custom stack.
- **Action:** Research report on "Google Antigravity" saved to `google-ai-studio-antigravity-research.md`.

### Coordination Layer
- **Action Item (Kevin):** Create Slack workspace (e.g., `KevinCrossHQ`) Saturday morning.
- **Next Step:** Dante to guide bot token creation and channel setup.

## Context & Notes
- **Kimi Issues:** Likely due to massive context window (3 days) causing API stream parsing errors. "Gatekeeping" by VPS ruled out.
- **Schedule:** Kevin is off for the night (Friday night). "Attack at dawn" (Saturday morning).
