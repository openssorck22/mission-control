# Memory Log: 2026-02-14 (Saturday)

## 🚨 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE UPDATE
- **Slack is LIVE.**
  - **App Name:** Dante (formerly Mission Control v2).
  - **Config:** Native Gateway, Socket Mode, Bot Token (`xoxb`).
  - **Channels:** 
    - `#mission-control` (Public feed/alerts).
    - `#talk-kevin-dante` (Private 1:1 strategy).
  - **Vision:** Enabled (`files:read` scope). Can read PDFs/Images.
  - **Protocol:** Use **Threads** to maintain context. Tag `@Dante` to wake me up.

## 🧠 Strategy Shift
- **The "Agency" Model:**
  - **Dante:** The Lead/CEO Agent.
  - **Sub-Agents:** Will be spun up for specific roles (e.g., Marketing, Research) and report back to Slack.
  - **Naming:** Agents get names, not generic titles.
- **Workflow:**
  - **Slack:** Communication & History. (The "Office").
  - **Telegram:** Rapid Command / Red Phone.
  - **Notion:** The "Brain" (State, Tasks, Knowledge). **<-- NEXT STEP**

## 🚧 Active Tasks
1.  **Notion Setup:** Connect Dante to Notion (Business Plan). Build "Mission Control" Dashboard.
2.  **Slack Optimization:** Reduce noise, organize channels.
3.  **Project Extraction:** Extract compliance data from NDCC PDF (uploaded to Slack) into Notion.

## ⚠️ Lessons Learned (The "Crash Loop")
- **NEVER** inject invalid schema into `openclaw.json`.
- Slack Channels must be `["C..."]` (Array), not Object or String.
- Slack App must have `app_mentions:read` AND Event Subscriptions (`message.channels`) to hear anything.
- **Watchdog Script:** Running to auto-disable Slack if it causes crashes.

## Projects
- **RollCall:** Gym SaaS.
- **Ratio:** Daycare SaaS (Compliance focus).
- **LS Concrete:** Acquisition target.

## 🏗️ Slack Architecture (Architect Sub-Agent Output)
- **The "Tri-Layer Approach":**
  1. **Human Lounge** (`#talk-*`): Decision-making, no bots allowed.
  2. **Agent Workshop** (`#work-*`): Where agents post deliverables.
  3. **System Console** (`#feed-*`): Logs/alerts (silent by default).
- **Channel Naming Prefixes:** `#talk-`, `#work-`, `#feed-`, `#biz[X]-`
- **No-Bot Rule:** Preserves human sanity in human channels.
- **Thread-First Workflow:** Agents reply in threads to keep feeds clean.
- **Dispatcher Pattern:** Single `#mission-control` channel for all task requests.

## 🔌 Infrastructure Finalization
- **Anthropic API Key:** Updated to latest (`sk-ant-api03-...`). Gateway restarted.
- **Slack PDF Vision:** CONFIRMED WORKING. Can read NDCC Rules Regs PDF. Capability proven.
- **Branding:** App renamed to just **\"Dante\"**. Generated CEO headshots (robot + human variants).
- **Primary Comms:** Moving to Slack. Same powers as Telegram, but with better history/context.
- **Notion:** Pending integration token + page ID from Kevin. Ready to build dashboard.
- **Model Preference:** Currently testing **Claude Haiku 4.5** for general operations (fast/responsive).

## 🌙 Evening Backup (5:00 PM)
- **Status:** Stabilization phase complete. Primary operations have shifted to Slack.
- **Pending:** Waiting on Kevin to drop the Notion Token and Page ID in Slack to wire up the "Brain".
- **State:** Dante is active and monitoring heartbeats. System is healthy.
- **Next High-Leverage Move:** Build the Notion Mission Control Dashboard once keys are provided.

## ⚡️ Decision Made
- **Kevin will provide Notion integration token + page ID in `#talk-kevin-dante`.**
- Once wired: Notion Dashboard = "Mission Control Brain" (Projects, Tasks, Knowledge).
- Slack = "Radio" (Communication & History).
- Telegram = "Red Phone" (Rapid Commands).
- **Goal:** $1M ARR via Agency Model (Dante + Sub-Agents).
