# Memory Log: 2026-02-15 (Sunday)

## 🕒 Status Check (10:00 AM)
- **Infrastructure:** System is stable after yesterday's Slack migration.
- **Quota Issues:** `google/gemini-3-pro-preview` hit a "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED" (429) error during the 9:00 AM heartbeat cycle. 
- **Auto-Failover:** The system automatically failed over to `google/gemini-3-flash-preview` for the 9:18 AM and 9:48 AM heartbeats to maintain continuity.
- **Heartbeat Status:** `HEARTBEAT.md` remains empty/comments-only; heartbeats are returning `HEARTBEAT_OK`.

## 🚧 Pending Items (From 2026-02-14)
- **Notion Integration:** Still waiting on Kevin to provide the Notion integration token and Page ID in the `#talk-kevin-dante` Slack channel. This is the blocker for building the "Mission Control" dashboard.
- **Project Extraction:** NDCC compliance data extraction to Notion is queued behind the Notion setup.

## 🧠 Memory Maintenance
- **continuity Check:** Verified daily logs from 2026-02-10 through 2026-02-14 are present.
- **Backup Schedule:** Twice-daily memory checkpoints are active via cron to ensure context is captured even if the system crashes or hits API limits.

## ⚡ Decisions & Insights
- **Model Resiliency:** The failover to Flash-preview during Pro-preview quota exhaustion proved effective for routine tasks (heartbeats), keeping the "lights on" without manual intervention.
- **Project Focus:** Priority remains RollCall (Gym SaaS), Ratio (Daycare SaaS), and LS Concrete Coatings (Acquisition/Marketing).
